# Polygon Rasterization

I'm thinking how to efficiently implement rasterization of flat 2D panels (of arbitrary polygon shape) into simple compact finite elements so I can use them for raytracing or radiosity solver. The elements should be such that they are well represented by single point and normal in center of mass of each elements. Therefore I don't want to have e.g. prolonged trinangles or quads which result from subdivision. I want elements which are compnact in the sense filling approximately some radius (sphere, circle). Regular hexagons are therefore good choice, but not every surface can be split to regular hexagons - especially near boundary of the polygon there will be some "left-overs"

So I was thinking about projection of the polygon on a regular hexagonal grid (defined in 2D plane coplanar with the plane of the flat polygon). For inner hexagons (which are fully inside the polygon) there is not problem. Now if there are any left-overs near the boundary of the polygon we can do two things:

1) Define new element which is not full hexagon, but partial (cutted hexagon). We need to compute surface area and new center-of-mass of this cutted shape. (because these are the values representing the surface element in the Radiosity calculation). This we can do easily by spliting the hexagon to 6 constituent triangles, and cutting each of them (cutted trinagle produce quad) and weighted average of the analytically calculated COGs of these quads.

2) If the cutted hexagon is small we do not want to represent it as independnet element. We want to merge it with the nearby surface element (each hexagon on the regular grid has 6 nearest neighbors, some of which may be outside the shape so we ommit them from consideration). Now we do not merge the hexagon as a whole, because we want to produce complact convex polygons. So we consider the new cutted trinagle already decomposed on triangles (resp. quads after cutting). We should take each of them and choose the neighbor hexagon with minimum "cost" of adding this piece of surface area (i.e. it should cost minimal change of COG of the element to wihich we add this new piece, which is equvalent to minimum distance of COG of this piece and the COG of element to which we add it)

For better efficiency and code organization, we should perhaps first generate all the hexagons (complete and incomplete), flag those incomplete. We should put the complete hexagons into some hashmap indexed by the pair of ix,iy indexes on the 2D hexagonal grid (indexes of hegaons are in fact vertexes of triangular grid), so we can quickly find all neighbors for the incomplete. The incomplete should go to separate list.

In the next pass we go only over the incomplete ones and try to split them to triangles, cut, and add these triangles into neighboring complete hexagons (updating the COG and area of those neighbors)

Now please write comprehensive, clear, understanable and didacting desing document how do implement this in code. It should be also tutorial for students.

Then write implementation of the algortihm using python and matplotlib. Use effiicnetly numpy array operations, masks and advanced indexing, and/or eventually list/dict comprehension. Avoid unnecesary loop and branching (if conditions) in python as they are slow. 

Finally the code should also contain visualization part.

## Design Document: High-Performance Hexagonal Rasterization

### 1. Objective

The goal remains to convert an arbitrary 2D polygon into a set of compact, finite elements based on a hexagonal grid, suitable for physics simulations. The key change is our approach: we will implement all necessary computational geometry primitives from scratch, avoiding external libraries, and adopt a more granular "divide-and-conquer" strategy for boundary elements.

### 2. Core Geometric Primitives (Self-Implemented)

Instead of `shapely`, we will implement our own set of geometry functions using `NumPy`. This ensures the logic is transparent and directly translatable to a language like C++.

#### 2.1. Polygon Representation
A polygon will be represented as a NumPy array of its vertices in order, with shape `(N, 2)`, where N is the number of vertices.

#### 2.2. Point-in-Polygon Test
To determine if a hexagon is fully inside the subject polygon, we need to test if all its vertices are inside. A standard and robust algorithm for this is the **Ray Casting Algorithm**.
*   **Concept:** Draw a horizontal ray from the test point to infinity. Count how many times this ray intersects the edges of the polygon.
*   **Rule:** An odd number of intersections means the point is inside; an even number means it's outside.
*   **Implementation:** We will create a function `is_inside(point, polygon_vertices)` that performs this check efficiently.

#### 2.3. Polygon Clipping: Sutherland-Hodgman Algorithm
This is the most critical operation for handling boundary elements. We need a function that finds the intersection of two polygons. The **Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm** is perfect for our needs because it clips a subject polygon against a *convex* clip polygon. Since our hexagons and their constituent triangles are convex, this is an ideal fit.
*   **Concept:** The algorithm processes the subject polygon against one edge of the clip polygon at a time. For each edge, it iterates through the vertices of the subject polygon, generating a new list of vertices that are on the "inside" of that edge's infinite line.
*   **Process:** After clipping against all edges of the convex clip polygon, the resulting list of vertices defines the final intersection shape.
*   **Implementation:** We will create a `clip(subject_polygon, clip_polygon)` function. This will be the workhorse for calculating the geometry of partial elements.

#### 2.4. Polygon Area: Shoelace Formula
To calculate the area of our final (potentially irregular) elements, we will use the **Shoelace (or Surveyor's) Formula**.
*   **Concept:** It calculates the area of any simple polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. It's extremely fast and works by summing the cross-products of consecutive vertex pairs.
*   **Formula:** `Area = 0.5 * |Σ(x_i * y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} * y_i)|`
*   **Implementation:** A vectorized NumPy implementation will be trivial and highly efficient.

#### 2.5. Polygon Centroid (Center of Mass)
The CoM of a polygon can also be calculated with a standard formula that complements the Shoelace method.
*   **Concept:** It's a weighted average of the centroids of triangles formed by the polygon's edges and the origin.
*   **Formula:**
    *   `C_x = (1 / 6A) * Σ((x_i + x_{i+1}) * (x_i * y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} * y_i))`
    *   `C_y = (1 / 6A) * Σ((y_i + y_{i+1}) * (x_i * y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} * y_i))`
    where `A` is the polygon's area.
*   **Implementation:** This can also be implemented efficiently with NumPy.

### 3. The Algorithm: A Step-by-Step Guide

The overall structure remains similar, but Stage 4 is fundamentally changed to incorporate your "divide-and-conquer" merging strategy.

#### Stage 1 & 2: Grid Generation and Classification 

1.  **Generate Grid:** Same as before, generate axial coordinates and their corresponding hexagon vertex arrays.
2.  **Classify Hexagons:**
    *   **Full Hexagons:** A hexagon is "Full" if all 6 of its vertices are inside the subject polygon (using our `is_inside` function). Add its `(q, r)` index to a `full_hex_list`.
    *   **Partial Hexagons:** A hexagon is "Partial" if it is not "Full" but its bounding box overlaps with the subject polygon's bounding box. This is a fast initial filter. We then confirm intersection by clipping the hexagon against the subject polygon. If the resulting clipped shape has a non-zero area, it is truly a partial hexagon. Add its `(q, r)` index to a `partial_hex_list`.

#### Stage 3: Initial Element Creation
Create the `elements_map` from the `full_hex_list`. Each element stores its vertices, area, and CoM.

#### Stage 4: Processing Partial Hexagons

This stage now operates on the triangular components of each partial hexagon individually.

1.  **Define Merge Threshold:** As before, define a `merge_threshold` area.

2.  **Iterate through `partial_hex_list`:** For each partial hexagon `H` with index `(q, r)`:
    a. **Decompose into Triangles:** Define the 6 constituent triangles of the hexagon. Each triangle is formed by the hexagon's center and two adjacent vertices.
    b. **Identify Neighbors:** Pre-determine the mapping between each of the 6 triangles and the 6 corresponding neighboring hexagons. For example, the triangle between vertex 0 and 1 is adjacent to the neighbor at `(q+1, r-1)` (depending on vertex order).
    c. **Process Each Triangle:** Loop through the 6 triangles of `H`. For each triangle `T_i`:
        i.   **Clip Triangle:** Clip `T_i` against the main subject polygon using the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm. This results in a smaller polygon piece, `P_i`.
        ii.  **Check if Valid:** If `P_i` is empty or has a negligible area, ignore it and continue to the next triangle.
        iii. **Calculate Properties:** Calculate the `area` and `CoM` of the piece `P_i` using the Shoelace and Centroid formulas.
        iv.  **Merge or Create New Logic:**
            *   **If `P_i.area` is below the threshold:**
                *   Find the corresponding neighbor hexagon `N_i` using the pre-determined mapping from step 2b.
                *   Check if `N_i` exists in our `elements_map` (i.e., it's a "Full" hexagon).
                *   If it exists, merge `P_i` into `N_i` by updating `N_i`'s area, CoM, and vertex list (by taking the convex hull of the combined points, or simply storing a list of polygons for the element).
                *   If the designated neighbor does not exist, `P_i` must become its own small, independent element.
            *   **If `P_i.area` is above the threshold:**
                *   Create a new, independent element from the piece `P_i`.

### 4. Final Output

The `elements_map` will contain two types of elements:
1.  Large, compact elements derived from full hexagons, potentially augmented by small merged boundary pieces.
2.  Medium-sized elements derived from larger boundary pieces that were not merged.

This revised approach is more computationally intensive upfront but results in a finer-grained and more physically accurate distribution of boundary area, while still maintaining the core goal of creating compact elements. The self-contained geometric functions make it a perfect blueprint for a C++ implementation.

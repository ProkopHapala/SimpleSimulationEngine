# What to do with GLCL

### Magneto-hydrodynamics

* Expasion of plasma-ball in magnetic field 
  * conductor generate such current which compensate change of magnetic field
  * solve equation A*I = dB/dt, where A is matrix of magnetic field, I is current, dB is change of magnetic field
* movement of particles in magnetic field
* filed of coil - besel function

### Areodynamics

* Potential flow - Biot-Savart law

### Particle-in-cell (PIC)

* like Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics, SPH (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics)
* Signed distance field

### Implosion, equations of state

* Cylindrical-coordinates (2D)
* Equations of state

### Terrain hydrodynamics
* fluid flow on terrain
* errosion by fluid flow

### Historical army 
* Total-wa like 
  * phalangs, cavalry, elephants
*  napoleonic wars - line-fomration, , artillery
* Stronghold-like - castle walls 

### Modern Army
* B-spline terain
* special terain features - circular (treas, spots), rectangular, polygonal (buildings, fields), linear-polylines (roads, railways, rivers, walls, fences, )

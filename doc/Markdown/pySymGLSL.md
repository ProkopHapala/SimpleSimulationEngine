I want to make physics simulation toolkit using glsl shaders with opengl in python using library
import moderngl

The simulation should be (for starter) not using compute shaders (although later we may start using them - not sure if it is good choice?). Instead we want to use rendering pipeline, multiple frame-buffers which are bind as input-textures for other shader (other render pass). The data (physical variables) should be stored between frames in frambuffer and then passed as texture into the next shader. 

This means it would be good to have some nice representation (not sure if class is overkill) which define render-pass (list of input buffers, output buffer), and then something like render que which execute them in given order. We should have some function to load shaders and compile them, reporting the compilation errors in terminal. For buffers, shaders we should have dictionaries so we can easily quarry them by name. 

We should make nice lightweight convenience layer on top of  moderngl which allows us to do this conveniently. I do not want to reinvent the wheel, I guess moderngl already have many of these features so try to make code consise and minimalistic and reuse existing features.

Before you start coding make analysis, detailed plan which I can review.

---

An excellent and well-thought-out project. Using the rendering pipeline for GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units) is a classic and powerful technique. The plan to create a lightweight convenience layer on top of `moderngl` is a solid approach.

Here is a detailed analysis and plan for your review.

### **Analysis of the Approach**

The core idea is to treat textures not as images, but as data buffers. A fragment shader, which normally calculates the color of a pixel, will instead calculate the result of a physics equation for a single point in our simulation space.

*   **The "Screen":** We will render to a framebuffer object (FBO) that is the same size as our simulation grid. For a 2D simulation of 512x512 particles, we would use a 512x512 texture.
*   **Data Passing (The "Ping-Pong"):** To maintain state between frames, we need at least two sets of textures for each variable (e.g., `position_A`, `position_B`, `velocity_A`, `velocity_B`). In a single simulation step, we will:
    1.  **Read** from textures `A` (the previous state).
    2.  **Calculate** the new state in the fragment shader.
    3.  **Write** the new state to textures `B`.
    4.  In the next step, we swap roles: read from `B` and write to `A`. This is the "ping-pong" technique.
*   **Why Not Compute Shaders (For Now):** Your decision to start with the rendering pipeline is sound. It is arguably more straightforward for grid-based data and is universally supported wherever OpenGL is. Compute shaders offer more flexibility (e.g., for non-grid data structures) but can introduce more complexity. The performance of this FBO-based approach is excellent and will not be a bottleneck for a wide range of simulations.

### **Leveraging `moderngl`**

We will lean heavily on `moderngl`'s high-level objects to keep our code concise.

*   **`moderngl.Program`**: For compiling GLSL shaders and passing uniforms. Its ability to reflect on uniforms is very useful.
*   **`moderngl.Texture`**: To store our simulation data. We will use floating-point textures (e.g., `dtype='f4'`) to get the necessary precision for physics variables. A single channel might be enough for one variable (like temperature), but we'll often use 3 or 4 channels (RGBA) to pack vectors like position (x, y, z) or velocity.
*   **`moderngl.Framebuffer`**: To wrap our data textures so we can render (i.e., write data) into them.
*   **`moderngl.VertexArray`**: A simple VAO will be used to render a full-screen quad. This is the standard trick to ensure our fragment shader runs once for every "pixel" (data point) in our textures.

---

### **Detailed Plan: The Convenience Layer**

Here is the proposed structure for our toolkit.

#### **1. Core Component: The `Simulation` Class**

This central class will manage the `moderngl` context, resources, and the overall simulation loop.

```python
# Pseudocode / Proposed Structure
class Simulation:
    def __init__(self, window_size, simulation_size):
        # 1. Initialize moderngl context
        self.ctx = moderngl.create_context()

        # 2. Resource Dictionaries
        self.programs = {}
        self.textures = {}
        self.framebuffers = {}

        # 3. Fullscreen Quad Geometry
        self.quad_fs = # ... create a simple VAO for a fullscreen triangle strip

    def load_program(self, name, vert_path=None, frag_path=None):
        # ... implementation below ...

    def create_texture_pair(self, name, size, components=4, dtype='f4'):
        # ... creates 'name_a' and 'name_b' textures ...

    def create_framebuffer_pair(self, name, size, texture_names):
        # ... creates 'name_a' and 'name_b' FBOs from textures ...

    def run(self):
        # ... The main application loop ...
```

#### **2. Resource Management**

We will implement methods on the `Simulation` class to populate the resource dictionaries as requested.

**Shader Loading (`load_program`)**

*   This method will take a user-friendly `name`, and paths to the vertex and fragment shader files.
*   It will read the source code from the files.
*   It will use a `try...except` block around `self.ctx.program(...)` to catch `moderngl.Error`.
*   If an error occurs, it will print the detailed compilation error to the terminal and raise an exception.
*   On success, it stores the compiled `moderngl.Program` in the `self.programs` dictionary with the given `name`.

**Texture and Framebuffer Creation (`create_texture_pair`, `create_framebuffer_pair`)**

*   To simplify the ping-pong setup, we'll have helper methods that create resources in pairs (`_a` and `_b`).
*   `create_texture_pair('position', ...)` will create `self.textures['position_a']` and `self.textures['position_b']`.
*   `create_framebuffer_pair(...)` will create two `moderngl.Framebuffer` objects, each attached to one of the corresponding textures.

#### **3. The `RenderPass` and `RenderQueue`**

Instead of a formal "queue" class which might be overkill, we can define a `RenderPass` as a simple, well-structured dictionary or a `dataclass`, and the main `run` loop can execute a list of these passes.

**`RenderPass` Definition**

A `RenderPass` will be a dictionary with a defined structure. This is lightweight and very Pythonic.

```python
# Example of a RenderPass dictionary
update_pass = {
    "program_name": "update_velocity",
    "input_textures": [
        {"name": "velocity_a", "uniform": "u_velocity_texture"},
        {"name": "forces_a", "uniform": "u_forces_texture"}
    ],
    "output_buffer_name": "velocity_b",
    "uniforms": {
        "u_deltatime": 0.016,
        "u_gravity": -9.81
    }
}
```

#### **4. The Execution Logic**

The core logic will live in a method on our `Simulation` class, perhaps called `execute_pass`. The main `run` loop will then call this for each pass, handling the swapping of `_a` and `_b` suffixes.

```python
# In the Simulation class
def execute_pass(self, render_pass):
    # 1. Get the program
    program = self.programs[render_pass['program_name']]
    self.ctx.use(program) # Not strictly needed in modern moderngl, but good practice

    # 2. Set uniforms
    for uniform_name, value in render_pass.get('uniforms', {}).items():
        if uniform_name in program:
            program[uniform_name] = value

    # 3. Bind input textures
    texture_unit = 0
    for tex_info in render_pass['input_textures']:
        texture = self.textures[tex_info['name']]
        texture.use(location=texture_unit)
        if tex_info['uniform'] in program:
            program[tex_info['uniform']] = texture_unit
        texture_unit += 1

    # 4. Bind output framebuffer and run
    output_fbo = self.framebuffers[render_pass['output_buffer_name']]
    output_fbo.use()
    self.quad_fs.render(moderngl.TRIANGLE_STRIP)

# In the main run loop
def run(self):
    # ... setup ...
    a, b = '_a', '_b'

    while not self.window.is_closing:
        # Define the passes for this frame
        passes = [
            {
                "program_name": "update_physics",
                "input_textures": [{"name": f"state_{a}", "uniform": "u_state"}],
                "output_buffer_name": f"state_{b}",
                "uniforms": {"u_deltatime": self.clock.tick()}
            },
            # ... other passes ...
        ]

        for p in passes:
            self.execute_pass(p)

        # The final pass renders to the screen
        self.ctx.screen.use()
        # ... bind final texture and render ...

        # SWAP for next frame
        a, b = b, a
```

### **Summary of the Plan**

1.  **Create a `Simulation` class:** This will be the main entry point, holding the `moderngl` context and resource dictionaries (`programs`, `textures`, `framebuffers`).
2.  **Implement Resource Helpers:** Add methods to `Simulation` for:
    *   `load_program`: Compiles GLSL shaders from files and handles errors.
    *   `create_texture_pair`: Creates ping-pong textures.
    *   `create_framebuffer_pair`: Creates ping-pong FBOs.
3.  **Standardize the `RenderPass`:** Define the structure of a `RenderPass` as a Python dictionary, specifying the program, inputs, output, and uniforms.
4.  **Implement the Executor:** Create an `execute_pass` method in the `Simulation` class that interprets a `RenderPass` dictionary to configure the GPU state and render a full-screen quad.
5.  **Build the Main Loop:** The `run` method will contain the main application loop. Inside it, a list of `RenderPass` dictionaries will be defined for each frame, and the `execute_pass` method will be called for each. It will also handle the crucial step of swapping the ping-pong suffixes (`_a`, `_b`) each frame.

This plan establishes a clear, minimal, and powerful foundation for your physics toolkit, staying true to your requirements of simplicity and leveraging `moderngl`'s strengths.

Few points:
1) Dictionaries are nice for human, but they are a bit slow, I would prefer to bake the reneding pass (texture binding, uniforms, etc.) into sombe context (VBO,VAO or something?) or at leaset store it in a list of handles/pointers of object, so we do not have to go through the complicated process every frame.
2) I definitely want to have some convenience function for user like "create pass" where he define filename with the shader, and the names of input buffers and output buffer, another function create texture where user define name, dimension and format (typically we will use floating-point RGBA so we can store vec4 (=float4) in it, so it should be default), then the user can refere to these texture names when defining render passes and render graph. Render graph should be provided as simple text program like list
[shader_name, output_texture, [input_textures], [parameters names]]

 as an example aplication lets consider some very simple grid-based fluid simulation for example like this
Simple and Fast Fluids
Martin Guay, Fabrice Colin, Richard Egli
https://inria.hal.science/inria-00596050/document

but this is just example, do not make this simulator to specific or hardcoded, it should be general platform for any simulation of this kind

---

Excellent points. Your feedback correctly identifies the potential performance bottleneck of repeated dictionary lookups and provides a clear vision for a more user-friendly, declarative API. This moves us from a good plan to a great one.

Here is the refined, more detailed plan that incorporates your suggestions.

---

### **Refined Plan: A "Baked" Render Graph Approach**

The core idea is to shift from a dynamic, dictionary-driven approach to a "baked" or "compiled" approach. We will perform all the expensive lookups and object preparations *once* during a setup phase. During the main loop (the "hot path"), we will only work with direct object references, eliminating string parsing and dictionary lookups.

#### **1. Core Components: `Simulation` and `RenderPass`**

We will introduce a formal class to represent a prepared render pass.

**`RenderPass` Class (The "Baked" Object)**

This class will be the heart of the optimization. Instead of a dictionary, we'll use a `dataclass` for a clean and efficient structure. An instance of this class will hold *direct references* to the `moderngl` objects it needs.

```python
# In a file like 'render_pass.py'
from dataclasses import dataclass
import moderngl

@dataclass
class RenderPass:
    """Holds the pre-compiled state for a single rendering pass."""
    program: moderngl.Program
    output_fbo: moderngl.Framebuffer  # Direct reference to the FBO to write to
    input_textures: list[moderngl.Texture] # Direct references to input textures
    
    # Store uniform objects for fast updates
    uniform_locations: dict[str, moderngl.Uniform] 
```

**`Simulation` Class (The Toolkit's API)**

This remains our main class, but its role is now to orchestrate the "baking" process and execute the prepared passes. It will expose the high-level API you described.

```python
# In a file like 'simulation.py'
import moderngl

class Simulation:
    def __init__(self, window_size, simulation_size):
        self.ctx = moderngl.create_context()
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.sim_size = simulation_size

        # Resource storage still uses dictionaries for easy setup by name
        self.programs = {}
        self.textures = {}  # Will store 'name_a', 'name_b'
        self.framebuffers = {} # Will store 'name_a', 'name_b'

        # The prepared render graph
        self.render_graph = [] 

        # Fullscreen quad for rendering
        self.quad_fs = # ... create a simple VAO ...

    # --- User-Facing API ---
    def create_texture(self, name: str, components=4, dtype='f4'):
        # ... implementation ...

    def create_pass(self, program_path: str, output_name: str, input_names: list[str], uniform_names: list[str] = []):
        # ... The "baking" function, returns a prepared RenderPass object ...

    def build_render_graph(self, graph_definition: list):
        # ... Takes the user's simple list and populates self.render_graph ...

    # --- Execution Logic ---
    def execute_graph(self, dynamic_uniforms: dict):
        # ... The highly optimized main loop executor ...

    def run(self):
        # ... The main application window loop ...
```

#### **2. The "Baking" Process (The `create_pass` method)**

This is the crucial step. When the user calls `create_pass`, we will do the following:

1.  **Load Program:** Load the GLSL shader from the given `program_path`. Compile it using `self.ctx.program(...)` and handle any compilation errors. Store it in the `self.programs` dictionary.
2.  **Resolve Names to Objects:** This is where the magic happens. The `create_pass` function will receive names like `"velocity"` or `"pressure"`. However, it needs to create *two* `RenderPass` objects: one for the `A -> B` step and one for the `B -> A` step to handle the ping-ponging.
3.  **Create `RenderPass` Instances:**
    *   **For the A -> B pass:**
        *   Look up `self.framebuffers[output_name + '_b']`.
        *   Look up `self.textures[input_name + '_a']` for each input.
        *   Get the `moderngl.Uniform` objects for each name in `uniform_names`.
        *   Instantiate `RenderPass(program=..., output_fbo=fbo_b, input_textures=[tex_a, ...], ...)` and add it to a list.
    *   **For the B -> A pass:**
        *   Do the same, but swap `_a` and `_b`.
        *   Instantiate the second `RenderPass` object.
4.  **The API will store these prepared `RenderPass` pairs**, ready for execution.

#### **3. The User-Friendly API in Detail**

**`create_texture(self, name, ...)`**

*   This function will automatically handle the ping-pong setup.
*   It creates two textures: `self.textures[name + '_a']` and `self.textures[name + '_b']`.
*   It creates two corresponding framebuffers: `self.framebuffers[name + '_a']` and `self.framebuffers[name + '_b']`.
*   The user only needs to think about the abstract data `name` (e.g., "velocity").

**`build_render_graph(self, graph_definition)`**

*   This convenience function will take the exact list format you proposed: `[shader_name, output_texture, [input_textures], [parameters]]`.
*   It will iterate through this list. For each entry, it will call `self.create_pass(...)`, which does the heavy lifting of baking the pass.
*   The resulting prepared `RenderPass` objects are stored in `self.render_graph`.

#### **4. The Highly Optimized Main Loop (`execute_graph`)**

The main `run` loop will be very clean. It determines which ping-pong state we are in (`a_to_b` or `b_to_a`) and calls `execute_graph`.

```python
# Inside the Simulation class
def execute_pass(self, pass_obj: RenderPass, dynamic_uniforms: dict):
    pass_obj.output_fbo.use()
    pass_obj.program.use()

    # Update dynamic uniforms (fast, no string lookups)
    for name, uniform_obj in pass_obj.uniform_locations.items():
        if name in dynamic_uniforms:
            uniform_obj.value = dynamic_uniforms[name]

    # Bind input textures (fast, no lookups)
    for i, texture in enumerate(pass_obj.input_textures):
        texture.use(location=i)

    self.quad_fs.render(moderngl.TRIANGLE_STRIP)

# --- In the main run() method ---
# a_b_flip = 0  (0 for A->B, 1 for B->A)
#
# while not window.is_closing:
#   dynamic_uniforms = {'u_time': time.time(), 'u_deltatime': dt}
#
#   for pass_pair in self.render_graph:
#       # Select the correct pre-baked pass for this frame
#       active_pass = pass_pair[a_b_flip] 
#       self.execute_pass(active_pass, dynamic_uniforms)
#
#   # Flip for next frame
#   a_b_flip = 1 - a_b_flip 
#
#   # Final render to screen etc.
```

### **Example Application: Simple Fluid Simulation**

Let's see how a user would interact with this refined toolkit.

```python
# main.py
from simulation import Simulation

# 1. Setup the simulation
sim = Simulation(window_size=(800, 800), simulation_size=(512, 512))

# 2. Create the data buffers (textures)
sim.create_texture("velocity")    # Creates velocity_a, velocity_b FBOs/Textures
sim.create_texture("pressure")    # Creates pressure_a, pressure_b
sim.create_texture("divergence")  # Only needs one, but our API makes a pair anyway
sim.create_texture("dye_color")

# 3. Define the render graph using the simple text-like format
# Format: [program_path, output_name, [input_names], [dynamic_uniform_names]]
graph = [
    ["shaders/advect.glsl", "velocity", ["velocity", "velocity"], ["u_deltatime"]],
    ["shaders/advect.glsl", "dye_color", ["velocity", "dye_color"], ["u_deltatime"]],
    ["shaders/divergence.glsl", "divergence", ["velocity"], []],
    ["shaders/jacobi.glsl", "pressure", ["pressure", "divergence"], []], # Jacobi solver
    ["shaders/project.glsl", "velocity", ["pressure", "velocity"], []] # Subtract pressure gradient
]

# 4. "Bake" the render graph
# This will create and store pairs of pre-configured RenderPass objects
sim.build_render_graph(graph)

# For the Jacobi pressure solver, we need to run that pass multiple times
# We can fetch the baked pass by name and run it manually in a loop
jacobi_pass_pair = sim.get_pass_pair_by_output("pressure")

# Modify the main loop to include the Jacobi iterations
def custom_run_loop():
    a_b_flip = 0
    while not sim.window.is_closing:
        dynamic_uniforms = {'u_deltatime': 0.016}
        
        # Run advection and divergence
        sim.execute_pass(sim.get_baked_pass("advect_velocity", a_b_flip), dynamic_uniforms)
        sim.execute_pass(sim.get_baked_pass("advect_dye", a_b_flip), dynamic_uniforms)
        sim.execute_pass(sim.get_baked_pass("divergence", a_b_flip), dynamic_uniforms)

        # Run Jacobi solver for N iterations
        for _ in range(20):
            sim.execute_pass(jacobi_pass_pair[a_b_flip], dynamic_uniforms)
            a_b_flip = 1 - a_b_flip # Ping-pong the pressure buffer

        # Run final projection step
        sim.execute_pass(sim.get_baked_pass("project", a_b_flip), dynamic_uniforms)

        # ... render final dye_color texture to screen ...

        # Flip all buffers for the next full step
        a_b_flip = 1 - a_b_flip

# 5. Start the simulation
sim.run(custom_run_loop) # Pass in a custom loop if needed
```

This revised plan directly addresses your concerns, resulting in a system that is both highly performant and offers a clean, declarative, and convenient API for the user.


---



I see some problem:
["shaders/advect.glsl", "velocity", ["velocity", "velocity"], ["u_deltatime"]],
we cannot use the same texture both as input and output. I think we need to have several velocity textures
the same with presure here
"shaders/jacobi.glsl", "pressure", ["pressure", "divergence"]

[Gemini generated bad desing]

---

No I still don't like this desing, the user when he is describing the render graph is responsioble for the flipping and ping-pong of the textures, he should explicitly refer to volocity_a and velocity_b, there should not be any python code handling it. The python just call the list of the render passes as they are, using the textures as they are

also when we loop over baked rendergraph we should no longer refer to the names and seek them in dictionaries, we should have the GL-object handes already baked in the list or tuples which we call as we iterate over the list of renderpasses (shader-calls) 





---



You are correct. My previous designs tried to abstract away the ping-pong mechanism, but your vision is for a more explicit, lower-level, and ultimately more flexible system. This is a very common and powerful pattern in graphics programming, as it gives the developer full control.

I will now propose a final plan that is built entirely on your principles:

1.  **The user is 100% responsible for managing the state.** They will explicitly name and use `_a` and `_b` textures.
2.  **The system will "bake" a render graph.** All string lookups and object preparations happen once, at the beginning.
3.  **The main loop will be "dumb and fast."** It will iterate over a list of pre-compiled objects and use direct `moderngl` handles, with no name lookups or conditional logic.

This is the right way to build a high-performance, general-purpose toolkit.

---

### **Final Plan: The Explicit "Baked Graph" Toolkit**

This plan puts the user in the driver's seat and optimizes the execution path to its absolute minimum.

#### **1. The "Baked" Data Structure: `BakedRenderPass`**

We will define a `dataclass` to hold the direct references to all the GPU resources needed for a single draw call. This is the core of the "no runtime lookups" principle.

```python
# In a file like 'core.py'
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Tuple, Any, Dict
import moderngl

@dataclass
class BakedRenderPass:
    """A fully resolved, ready-to-execute render pass. Contains no names, only direct object handles."""
    program: moderngl.Program
    output_fbo: moderngl.Framebuffer
    
    # A list of tuples: (texture_object, uniform_location_int)
    # This is extremely efficient to loop over. The uniform telling the shader which
    # texture unit to use is set once during baking.
    inputs: List[Tuple[moderngl.Texture, int]] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    # A dictionary mapping a user-friendly name to a uniform object.
    # Used for updating dynamic per-frame values like delta_time.
    dynamic_uniforms: Dict[str, moderngl.Uniform] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

#### **2. The `Simulation` Class (The "Compiler" and Executor)**

The `Simulation` class will serve two distinct roles:
1.  **A resource manager and compiler:** It will provide convenience functions to create textures and FBOs, and a `bake_graph` method to translate a user's plan into the `BakedRenderPass` objects.
2.  **A simple executor:** It will have a `run_graph` method that just loops over the baked passes.

```python
# In a file like 'simulation.py'
import moderngl
# ... other imports

class Simulation:
    def __init__(self, window_size, sim_size):
        self.ctx = moderngl.create_context()
        self.window_size = window_size
        self.sim_size = sim_size

        # --- Resource Dictionaries (Used ONLY during baking) ---
        self._programs: Dict[str, moderngl.Program] = {} # Path -> Program
        self.textures: Dict[str, moderngl.Texture] = {}
        self.framebuffers: Dict[str, moderngl.Framebuffer] = {}
        
        # --- The Final, High-Performance Render Graph ---
        self.render_graph: List[BakedRenderPass] = []
        
        # A simple VAO for rendering a fullscreen quad
        self.quad_fs = self._create_fullscreen_quad()

    # --- API for Resource Creation ---
    def create_texture(self, name: str, components=4, dtype='f4'):
        """Creates a single texture and stores it by its unique name."""
        tex = self.ctx.texture(self.sim_size, components, dtype=dtype)
        self.textures[name] = tex

    def create_framebuffer(self, name: str, texture_name: str):
        """Creates an FBO attached to a single texture."""
        if texture_name not in self.textures:
            raise KeyError(f"Texture '{texture_name}' not found for FBO '{name}'")
        fbo = self.ctx.framebuffer(color_attachments=[self.textures[texture_name]])
        self.framebuffers[name] = fbo

    # --- The "Compiler" ---
    def bake_graph(self, user_graph_def: List[Dict]):
        """

#### **3. Example User Application (Fluid Simulation)**

This demonstrates how the user has explicit control over the entire process.

```python
# main.py
from simulation import Simulation

# 1. Initialize the toolkit
sim = Simulation(window_size=(800, 800), sim_size=(512, 512))

# 2. User explicitly creates every resource needed for ping-ponging
sim.create_texture("velocity_a")
sim.create_texture("velocity_b")
sim.create_texture("dye_a")
sim.create_texture("dye_b")
# ... etc. for divergence and pressure

# Create corresponding Framebuffers
sim.create_framebuffer("fbo_velocity_a", "velocity_a")
sim.create_framebuffer("fbo_velocity_b", "velocity_b")
sim.create_framebuffer("fbo_dye_a", "dye_a")
sim.create_framebuffer("fbo_dye_b", "dye_b")
# ... etc.

# 3. User defines the full render sequence, explicitly stating inputs and outputs.
# Let's say one frame of simulation involves advecting velocity, then dye.
render_sequence_A_to_B = [
    {
        "program": "shaders/advect.glsl",
        "output": "fbo_velocity_b",  # Write to B
        "inputs": [
            # Read from A for both inputs to advect velocity by itself
            {"texture": "velocity_a", "uniform": "u_velocity_field"}, 
            {"texture": "velocity_a", "uniform": "u_quantity_to_advect"}
        ],
        "dynamic_uniforms": ["u_deltatime"]
    },
    {
        "program": "shaders/advect.glsl",
        "output": "fbo_dye_b", # Write to B
        "inputs": [
            # Read NEW velocity from B, but old dye color from A
            {"texture": "velocity_b", "uniform": "u_velocity_field"}, 
            {"texture": "dye_a", "uniform": "u_quantity_to_advect"}
        ],
        "dynamic_uniforms": ["u_deltatime"]
    },
    # ... other passes for divergence, pressure, projection ...
]

# The user would also define the B -> A sequence for the next frame
render_sequence_B_to_A = [
    {
        "program": "shaders/advect.glsl",
        "output": "fbo_velocity_a", # Write to A
        "inputs": [{"texture": "velocity_b", ...}, {"texture": "velocity_b", ...}],
        "dynamic_uniforms": ["u_deltatime"]
    },
    # ... etc.
]

# 4. Bake both sequences
sim.bake_graph(render_sequence_A_to_B)
baked_graph_A_to_B = sim.render_graph  # Store the result

sim.bake_graph(render_sequence_B_to_A)
baked_graph_B_to_A = sim.render_graph # Store the result

# 5. Run the main loop, explicitly choosing which baked graph to run
frame_is_even = True
while True: # Main loop
    
    dynamic_values = {"u_deltatime": 0.016}

    if frame_is_even:
        sim.render_graph = baked_graph_A_to_B
    else:
        sim.render_graph = baked_graph_B_to_A
    
    sim.run_graph(dynamic_uniform_values=dynamic_values)

    # ... code to render final texture to screen ...
    
    frame_is_even = not frame_is_even
```

This final plan fully embodies your design philosophy. It is clean, highly performant, and gives the end-user complete and unambiguous control over the simulation logic.

few notes the famebuffer name should be same as texture name, so instead of 
sim.create_framebuffer("fbo_velocity_a", "velocity_a")
we can use just 
sim.create_framebuffer("velocity_a")

for render-pass inputs we are fine with tuples instead of lists, I do not like unnecesary use of dictionary where list or tuple is fine
instead of
 {
        "program": "shaders/advect.glsl",
        "output": "fbo_velocity_b",  # Write to B
        "inputs": [
            # Read from A for both inputs to advect velocity by itself
            {"texture": "velocity_a", "uniform": "u_velocity_field"}, 
            {"texture": "velocity_a", "uniform": "u_quantity_to_advect"}
        ],
        "dynamic_uniforms": ["u_deltatime"]
    },

lets have

[ "shaders/advect.glsl", "velocity_b", ["velocity_a","velocity_a"], ["u_deltatime"] ],

Excellent. This is the final iteration that refines the API to be as lean and direct as possible, just as you've requested. We will adopt the tuple-based definition and the simplified framebuffer creation.

This design is minimalist, highly performant, and puts all control in the hands of the user who is authoring the graph.

---

### **Final, Agreed-Upon Plan**

#### **1. Guiding Principles**

*   **Explicit is Better than Implicit:** The user explicitly defines all resources (`texture_a`, `texture_b`) and the exact sequence of operations. No magic.
*   **Compile, then Run:** All setup, name resolution, and object linking (`baking`) is done once. The main loop only executes pre-compiled, optimized instructions.
*   **Convention over Configuration:** To simplify the API, we establish a fixed convention for naming texture uniforms in GLSL (`u_texture_0`, `u_texture_1`, etc.).

#### **2. Core Data Structures & Classes**

**`BakedRenderPass` Dataclass (Unchanged)**

This structure is already optimal. It holds direct `moderngl` object references for maximum performance.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
import moderngl

@dataclass
class BakedRenderPass:
    program: moderngl.Program
    output_fbo: moderngl.Framebuffer
    inputs: List[Tuple[moderngl.Texture, int]] # (Texture Object, Texture Unit)
    dynamic_uniforms: Dict[str, moderngl.Uniform]
```

**`Simulation` Class (API and Logic Refined)**

This class implements the new, leaner API.

```python
class Simulation:
    def __init__(self, window_size, sim_size):
        self.ctx = moderngl.create_context()
        self.sim_size = sim_size
        self.quad_fs = self._create_fullscreen_quad()

        # --- Resource Dictionaries (Used ONLY during baking) ---
        self._programs: Dict[str, moderngl.Program] = {}
        self.textures: Dict[str, moderngl.Texture] = {}
        self.framebuffers: Dict[str, moderngl.Framebuffer] = {}
        
    # --- API for Resource Creation (Refined) ---
    def create_texture(self, name: str, components: int = 4, dtype: str = 'f4'):
        """Creates a single texture and a corresponding framebuffer with the same name."""
        if name in self.textures:
            raise ValueError(f"Texture with name '{name}' already exists.")
            
        tex = self.ctx.texture(self.sim_size, components, dtype=dtype)
        fbo = self.ctx.framebuffer(color_attachments=[tex])
        
        self.textures[name] = tex
        self.framebuffers[name] = fbo
        print(f"Created texture and FBO: '{name}'")

    # ... private helper methods for shader loading and quad creation ...
```

#### **3. Example User Application (Fluid Simulation with Final API)**

This shows the final, clean workflow.

**GLSL Shader Snippet (`shaders/advect.glsl`)**

Note the uniform naming convention.

```glsl
#version 330 core

uniform sampler2D u_texture_0; // Convention: The velocity field
uniform sampler2D u_texture_1; // Convention: The quantity to advect (e.g., color or velocity itself)

uniform float u_deltatime;
// ... other uniforms ...

in vec2 v_texcoord;
out vec4 f_color;

void main() {
    // Sample velocity from the first input texture
    vec2 velocity = texture(u_texture_0, v_texcoord).xy;

    // Go back in time along the velocity vector
    vec2 prev_pos = v_texcoord - velocity * u_deltatime;

    // Sample the quantity from the second input texture at the previous position
    f_color = texture(u_texture_1, prev_pos);
}
```

**Main Python Application (`main.py`)**

```python
from simulation import Simulation
# Assume a windowing library like pyglet or pygame is used for the context/loop

# 1. Initialize the toolkit
sim = Simulation(window_size=(800, 800), sim_size=(512, 512))

# 2. Create ping-pong resources. The API is now very clean.
sim.create_texture("velocity_a")
sim.create_texture("velocity_b")
sim.create_texture("dye_a")
sim.create_texture("dye_b")
sim.create_texture("pressure_a")
sim.create_texture("pressure_b")
sim.create_texture("divergence") # Only one is needed, but we create a pair for consistency.

# 3. Define render graphs using the concise tuple format.
# Format: (program_path, output_name, [input_names], [dynamic_uniform_names])

# --- Graph for Frame 1 (A -> B) ---
graph_A_to_B = [
    # Advect velocity by itself: read from velocity_a, write to velocity_b
    ("shaders/advect.glsl", "velocity_b", ["velocity_a", "velocity_a"], ["u_deltatime"]),
    # Compute divergence from new velocity: read velocity_b, write divergence
    ("shaders/divergence.glsl", "divergence", ["velocity_b"], []),
    # Advect dye: read NEW velocity_b and OLD dye_a, write to dye_b
    ("shaders/advect.glsl", "dye_b", ["velocity_b", "dye_a"], ["u_deltatime"]),
    # ... jacobi and project passes would follow a similar explicit pattern
]

# --- Graph for Frame 2 (B -> A) ---
graph_B_to_A = [
    # Advect velocity by itself: read from velocity_b, write to velocity_a
    ("shaders/advect.glsl", "velocity_a", ["velocity_b", "velocity_b"], ["u_deltatime"]),
    # Compute divergence from new velocity: read velocity_a, write divergence
    ("shaders/divergence.glsl", "divergence", ["velocity_a"], []),
    # Advect dye: read NEW velocity_a and OLD dye_b, write to dye_a
    ("shaders/advect.glsl", "dye_a", ["velocity_a", "dye_b"], ["u_deltatime"]),
    # ... etc. ...
]

# 4. Bake both graphs *once* at setup time.
baked_A_to_B = sim.bake_graph(graph_A_to_B)
baked_B_to_A = sim.bake_graph(graph_B_to_A)

# 5. The main application loop is simple and fast.
frame_count = 0
while True: # e.g., while not window.is_closing
    dynamic_values = {"u_deltatime": 0.016}

    # Alternate between the two pre-baked graphs
    if frame_count % 2 == 0:
        sim.run_graph(baked_A_to_B, dynamic_values)
        # To display, we would now render the content of "dye_b" to the screen
        texture_to_display = sim.textures["dye_b"]
    else:
        sim.run_graph(baked_B_to_A, dynamic_values)
        # To display, we would now render the content of "dye_a" to the screen
        texture_to_display = sim.textures["dye_a"]

    # ... code to render texture_to_display to the screen ...
    
    frame_count += 1
    # window.swap_buffers()
```

This plan is now fully aligned with your specifications, resulting in a design that is maximally efficient, transparent, and flexible. It provides the necessary convenience for resource creation while giving you, the developer, complete control over the render graph logic.

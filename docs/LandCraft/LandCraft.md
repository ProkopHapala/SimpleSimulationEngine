# LandCraft: Geographic Economy Simulation Game

## Overview

LandCraft is a sophisticated economy-building simulation game focused on the interplay between geography, natural resources, and large-scale infrastructure development. The game challenges players to build thriving civilizations by strategically utilizing natural terrain features, managing resource distribution, and constructing complex transportation networks.

## Core Game Philosophy

The game emphasizes **geographic determinism** - how natural features like rivers, mountains, and resource deposits fundamentally shape economic development. Players must work within the constraints of the terrain while gradually modifying it through massive infrastructure projects.

## Key Systems Integration

### 1. Geographic Foundation
- **Terrain Generation**: Procedural creation of realistic landscapes using noise algorithms
- **Hydraulic Simulation**: Dynamic water flow that creates rivers, lakes, and drainage basins
- **Resource Distribution**: Natural resources placed according to geological realism

### 2. Economic Engine
- **Commodity System**: Multi-resource economy with supply/demand dynamics
- **Production Chains**: Complex manufacturing requiring multiple inputs and processes
- **Technology Tree**: Player has whole technology tree from start. Only available resources limit technology which can be used (e.g. no steel production without iron). This is similar to Stronghold or Factorio. 

### 3. Infrastructure Networks
- **Transportation**: Roads, railways, and waterways with realistic capacity constraints
- **Hydraulic Engineering**: Dams, canals, and water management systems
- **Path Optimization**: AI-driven route planning considering terrain and cost factors

### 4. Environmental Interaction
- **Terrain Modification**: Large-scale earthworks for infrastructure projects
- **Hydraulic Impact**: Construction affects water flow and drainage patterns
- **Ecosystem Consequences**: Environmental changes impact resource availability

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Survey Phase**: Analyze terrain, identify resources, and plan development
2. **Infrastructure Phase**: Build transportation networks to connect resources
3. **Economic Phase**: Establish production chains and trade networks
4. **Expansion Phase**: Scale up operations and tackle larger projects
5. **Adaptation Phase**: Respond to environmental changes and resource depletion

## Technical Architecture

The game integrates multiple specialized systems:

- **TerrainHydraulics**: 2D water flow simulation for rivers and lakes
- **PathFinder**: Optimal routing algorithms for infrastructure
- **Economy**: Resource management and production simulation
- **Roads**: Detailed road construction and vehicle movement
- **Rendering**: Efficient visualization of large-scale terrain

## Strategic Depth

Success requires balancing:
- **Efficiency vs. Cost**: Faster routes may be more expensive to build (more terrain to modify)
- **Environmental Impact**: Large projects have lasting consequences
- **Resource Timing**: Infrastructure must precede resource extraction 
- **Geographic Constraints**: Natural features both help and hinder development. River is both obstacle and pathway.

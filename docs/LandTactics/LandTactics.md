# LandTactics: Tactical Combat Simulation Game

## Overview

LandTactics is a sophisticated 2D top-down tactical combat simulator that models modern and World War II-era military engagements. The system operates at the squad level, managing groups of military vehicles and soldiers across large-scale battlefields while simulating realistic terrain effects, visibility, cover systems, and tactical decision-making.

## Game Philosophy

The simulation emphasizes **realistic tactical combat** where terrain, unit positioning, and tactical coordination determine battle outcomes. Unlike arcade-style games, LandTactics models authentic military physics including ballistics, armor penetration, line-of-sight calculations, and unit morale effects.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Strategic Deployment**: Position units based on terrain analysis
2. **Tactical Movement**: Navigate using realistic physics and terrain
3. **Engagement**: Calculate ballistics, armor effects, and damage
4. **Morale Management**: Handle suppression and unit effectiveness
5. **Victory Conditions**: Achieve tactical objectives through superior positioning

## Key Systems Integration

### 1. Terrain and Environment
- **Shared with LandCraft**: Uses same terrain systems for consistency
- **Elevation effects**: Height advantage for visibility and range
- **Water features**: Rivers as obstacles and tactical barriers
- **Cover system**: Buildings, forests, and terrain provide protection

### 2. Unit Management
- **Squad-based**: Groups of units move and fight together
- **Individual units**: Each unit has unique characteristics and state
- **Formation system**: Tactical positioning within squads
- **Command hierarchy**: Factions → Squads → Individual units

### 3. Combat Mechanics
- **Realistic ballistics**: Physics-based projectile motion
- **Armor modeling**: Directional armor with penetration calculations
- **Damage system**: Component-based damage affecting unit capabilities
- **Suppression**: Morale effects reducing combat effectiveness

### 4. Visibility and Line-of-Sight
- **Top-down perspective**: 2D battlefield overview
- **Obstacle blocking**: Terrain and objects affect visibility
- **Range calculations**: Weapon effectiveness based on distance
- **Cover evaluation**: Protection assessment for tactical decisions

## Technical Architecture

## Configuration System

### Unit Definition Files
- **Text-based**: Easy modification and creation
- **Comprehensive**: All unit characteristics configurable
- **Validation**: Error checking and duplicate detection
- **Extensibility**: New unit types easily added

### Scenario Creation
- **Terrain generation**: Procedural or custom battlefields
- **Unit placement**: Strategic deployment options
- **Victory conditions**: Customizable objectives
- **Balance testing**: Tools for scenario validation

This system provides a comprehensive tactical simulation platform that bridges the gap between realistic military modeling and engaging gameplay, leveraging proven terrain and physics systems while adding sophisticated combat mechanics.

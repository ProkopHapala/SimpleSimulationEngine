## USER 1


Now another think is to calculate armor penetration. 

One idea is to consider kinetic energy and some pressure. Basically the path * area  * pressure(=strenght) is some volumetric energy (pV=E) (or p*S*L=E). Given armor of given strengh with given thinkcnes can absorb some energy per area, the are is given by crossection of the wepon. Or if it is pointy weapon we can consider the angle and that the area is increasing as we go deaper into the target.

However intuitivelyt I would think that weapons with higher momentum are better versus armor, which the equations above does not reflect. 

I can see two ways how to model this.

1) blunt damage can be directly proportinal to momentum (rather than to energy), and this damage ignore the armor

2) we can consider that some part of energy is lost in inelastic collision with the armor (padding). So if we say that the armor moved by the impact has mass M and our weapon head m the energy in this collision is changed proprotionally to m/(m+M)  (am I right? please check it by properly solving inelastic collision) 

3) edge lengh can cause more damage than narrow point. We should somehow consider this. We should consider wound depth and width, assuming that the material behind armor (flash) is much less strong than the armor. 

Try to suggest some equations

This is an excellent line of questioning that gets to the heart of modeling complex physical interactions for a game. You are correct on all points: momentum is crucial for defeating armor, the mechanism of damage is not one-size-fits-all, and the geometry of the weapon head is paramount.

Let's break this down and build a robust model. We'll synthesize your ideas into a unified system with three distinct damage mechanisms: **Piercing, Cutting, and Crushing (Blunt)**.

### The Core Principle: Energy vs. Momentum

You've hit upon a critical distinction.
*   **Kinetic Energy (KE)** is the capacity to do *work*. Work means deforming, cutting, or breaking material. **KE is the primary driver of armor *failure* (penetration).**
*   **Momentum (p)** is the capacity to move mass. When a weapon hits armor, it transfers momentum to the armor and the body behind it. **Momentum is the primary driver of *blunt force trauma* through armor and staggering/knockback.**

A good model needs both.

### Validating Your Inelastic Collision Idea (Idea #2)

Your intuition about the `m/(m+M)` factor is spot on. Let's quickly prove it. In a perfectly inelastic collision (the weapon strikes and sticks to the armor for a moment), momentum is conserved:

1.  Initial Momentum: `p_i = m_head * v_initial`
2.  Final Momentum: `p_f = (m_head + M_armor) * v_final`
3.  `m_head * v_initial = (m_head + M_armor) * v_final`
4.  Solving for final velocity: `v_final = v_initial * (m_head / (m_head + M_armor))`

Now, let's look at the kinetic energy of the target *after* the impact. This is the energy that travels *through* the armor to cause bruising, broken bones, and organ damage.

*   `KE_transferred = 0.5 * M_armor * v_final^2` (This is one way to see it)
*   A better way for gameplay is to look at the total kinetic energy of the combined system after impact: `KE_final = 0.5 * (m_head + M_armor) * v_final^2`.
*   Substituting `v_final`: `KE_final = 0.5 * (m_head + M_armor) * [v_initial * (m_head / (m_head + M_armor))]^2`
*   This simplifies to: `KE_final = (0.5 * m_head * v_initial^2) * (m_head / (m_head + M_armor))`
*   Which is: `KE_final = KE_initial * (m_head / (m_head + M_armor))`

**Conclusion: You were exactly right.** The fraction of the initial kinetic energy that is converted into moving the target (and thus causing blunt trauma) is proportional to `m_head / (m_head + M_armor)`. A heavier weapon head (`m_head`) is vastly more effective at transferring this energy.

### A Unified Armor Penetration Model

Let's build the equations. First, we need to add more properties to our weapons and define a target.

#### New Weapon Head Properties:
*   `type`: A list of damage types it can deal (e.g., `['Piercing', 'Crushing']`)
*   `contact_area_m2`: For piercing tips. A tiny number, like `0.00001` m² (10 mm²).
*   `edge_length_m`: For cutting blades. A larger number, like `0.3` m for a glaive.

#### Target Armor Properties:
*   `name`: e.g., "Knight in Plate"
*   `yield_strength_Pa`: The pressure needed to permanently deform/pierce the armor. Plate steel is ~350-900 MPa (let's use **500,000,000 Pascals** for good steel).
*   `thickness_m`: e.g., **0.002 m** (2mm).
*   `blunt_mass_kg`: The effective mass of the armored body part. For a torso hit, this might be **12 kg** (chest, part of torso, etc.).

---

### The Damage Calculation Equations

For any given attack, we calculate the following:

#### 1. Crushing (Blunt) Damage
This happens on *every* hit, regardless of penetration. It's the shockwave.

`KE_initial =` The `KE Swing` or `KE Thrust` from our previous script.
`m_head =` The mass of the weapon's head.
`M_armor =` The target's `blunt_mass_kg`.

**`Energy_Crushing = KE_initial * (m_head / (m_head + M_armor))`**

This energy represents the damage dealt "through" the armor.

#### 2. Piercing Damage
This only applies if the weapon head has the 'Piercing' type and the attack is a thrust.

`Armor_Toughness_P = yield_strength_Pa * contact_area_m2 * thickness_m`
This is the total energy (in Joules) the armor can absorb over its thickness at that point.

If `KE_initial > Armor_Toughness_P`:
    **`Energy_Piercing = KE_initial - Armor_Toughness_P`**
Else:
    `Energy_Piercing = 0`

#### 3. Cutting Damage
This only applies if the weapon has the 'Cutting' type and the attack is a swing. It's about energy density along an edge.

`Energy_Density_C = KE_initial / edge_length_m` (in Joules/meter)

`Armor_Toughness_C = yield_strength_Pa * (thickness_m^2)`
(This is a simplification, but it correctly models that cutting gets exponentially harder with thickness).

If `Energy_Density_C > Armor_Toughness_C`:
    `Excess_Density = Energy_Density_C - Armor_Toughness_C`
    **`Energy_Cutting = Excess_Density * edge_length_m`**
Else:
    `Energy_Cutting = 0`

### Analysis of Example Results

Let's run the numbers for our examples:

**1. Spear 2H Thrust (KE = 199 J, m_head = 0.3 kg) vs. Knight**
*   **Crushing:** `199 * (0.3 / (0.3 + 12)) = 199 * 0.024 = **4.8 J**` (A very small jolt)
*   **Piercing:**
    *   `Armor_Toughness_P = 500e6 * 0.00002 * 0.002 = **20 J**`
    *   `199 J > 20 J`, so it penetrates!
    *   `Energy_Piercing = 199 - 20 = **179 J**`
*   **Total Damage:** `4.8 + 179 = 183.8 J` (A devastatingly successful thrust)

**2. Poleaxe Swing (KE = 261 J, m_head = 2.2 kg) vs. Knight**
*   **Crushing:** `261 * (2.2 / (2.2 + 12)) = 261 * 0.155 = **40.4 J**` (A massive, bone-shattering impact, even if it doesn't penetrate!)
*   **Cutting (using its 0.15m axe edge):**
    *   `Energy_Density_C = 261 J / 0.15 m = 1740 J/m`
    *   `Armor_Toughness_C = 500e6 * (0.002^2) = 500e6 * 4e-6 = 2000 J/m`
    *   `1740 < 2000`, so it fails to cut the plate armor. `Energy_Cutting = 0`.
*   **Total Damage:** `40.4 J`. It doesn't cut the plate, but it delivers a massive blunt force blow.

**Gameplay Conclusion:**
This model beautifully illustrates historical reality.
*   **Spears** are useless against plate mail *unless* you can generate enough energy in a thrust to hit the armor's piercing threshold. Our strong soldier *can*, making the spear a viable (but specialized) anti-armor weapon.
*   **Axes and swords (cutting)** are terrible at defeating plate armor. Our model shows the Poleaxe's edge glancing off.
*   The **Poleaxe's** true value against a knight is its massive head weight. Even when the edge doesn't bite, it delivers **8.4 times more blunt damage** than the spear, crushing the armor and the person inside. This is why maces, warhammers, and poleaxes were the kings of late-medieval combat. Your model now reflects this perfectly.

## USER 2

Your ideas are good just do not complicate the script by considering polearms mechanics. We want to have these separate. 

Consider just different targets cases of armor (without narmor, cloth/leather atmor, steel armor) , and different body parts  (head, troso, limb)

and the attack is decribed only by the variables like velocity, mass, (which determine momentum and kinetic energy), no matter what the weapon is 

And then we have edge length, ( eventually for spike it is angle of pointeness, which says how fast the edge lenght grow as the spike goes depaer into the target )

make me python script for such model

---

Of course. This is a great way to structure the problem. We will create a self-contained damage calculation script that is completely independent of the weapon physics that generated the impact. It will only care about the properties of the impact itself.

The model will be based on the following principles:

1.  **Crushing Damage:** Every impact delivers blunt force trauma, calculated from the initial kinetic energy and the masses involved. This damage is reduced by padding but is always present.
2.  **Armor Defeat Threshold:** Armor has a certain toughness (based on material strength and thickness) that must be overcome by the energy density of the attack.
3.  **Penetrating Damage:** If the armor's threshold is overcome, the remaining energy is converted into cutting or piercing damage to the body part behind it.
4.  **Body Part Modifiers:** The final damage is modified based on the lethality of the body part hit.

Here is the Python script that implements this model.

```python

### Analysis of the Results

The script will produce a detailed breakdown for each scenario. Let's analyze the output to see the logical gameplay roles that emerge:

**--- IMPACT: LIGHT SWORD SLASH ---**
*   **vs. Unarmored Torso:** High penetrating damage. A lethal cut.
*   **vs. Cloth Torso:** Cloth offers minimal resistance. Still a very damaging cut.
*   **vs. Steel Torso:** `Penetrating Damage: 0.0`. The slash has no hope of cutting steel. It only deals a tiny amount of crushing damage. This is historically accurate.

**--- IMPACT: HEAVY AXE CHOP ---**
*   **vs. Unarmored/Cloth Torso:** Massive penetrating damage. The high energy on a short edge is devastating.
*   **vs. Steel Torso:** Still likely `Penetrating Damage: 0.0`. However, its `Crushing Damage` will be significantly higher than the sword's due to its higher mass. It hurts the target *through* the armor.
*   **vs. Steel Head:** Even more `Crushing Damage`. This represents a stunning, concussive blow that could incapacitate a knight without penetration.

**--- IMPACT: FAST DAGGER STAB ---**
*   **vs. Unarmored/Cloth Torso:** Good penetration, but less overall energy than a big weapon, so the final damage score is lower.
*   **vs. Steel Torso:** This is where it gets interesting. Despite its low total energy, the dagger's sharp point and the piercing model might allow it to achieve partial or full penetration where the axe chop could not, especially if aimed at thinner sections (which the model handles via body part definitions). This models finding gaps in armor.

**--- IMPACT: SPEAR POWER THRUST ---**
*   **vs. Steel Torso:** This is the ideal anti-armor weapon. It has high mass AND high velocity, concentrated on a very sharp point (`point_angle_deg: 10`). This impact will likely achieve full `Armor Penetration` and deliver a massive amount of `Penetrating Damage` behind the plate.
*   **vs. Steel Head:** A catastrophic, lethal hit. The high base damage combined with the head's x3 multiplier results in a huge `FINAL DAMAGE SCORE`.

This decoupled model is robust and versatile. You can feed it inputs from your previous polearm script, or from scripts for swords, axes, arrows, or even monster claws, and it will consistently calculate the outcome based on the fundamental physics of the impact.
